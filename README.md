# Missing Error Handling and Specific Error Messages in Express.js Route
This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling and lack of specific error messages.

The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  It lacks proper handling for cases where:

1. The `userId` is not a valid number.
2. No user with the given ID is found.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and more informative error responses.
